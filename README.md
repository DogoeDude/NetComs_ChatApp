We are utilizing the PYQT for Python to create a chat application GUI.

In terms of the logic, we are using the socket library to create a client-server connection. The client will be able to send messages to the server and the server will be able to send messages to the client.

The server will be able to send messages to all connected clients. The server will be able to handle multiple clients concurrently.

The server will be able to handle client disconnections and reconnects. The server will be able to handle client connections and disconnections.
