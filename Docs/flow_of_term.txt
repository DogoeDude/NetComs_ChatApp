    Flow of the Local Chat:
        a. To start the server, run the command "python server.py" in the terminal.
        b. When the server is running, it will listen for connections and proceed with the handshake protocols.
        c. The server will then wait for the a to connect.
        d. Connect to the server by running the command "python client.py" in the terminal.
        e. When the client connects, the server will acknowledge the connection and proceed with the handshake protocols and also log the connection.
        f. The server will then wait for the client to send a message and each message will be logged and broadcasted to all connected clients.
        g. When the client sends a message, the server will parse the message and display it.
        h. The server will then broadcast the message to all connected clients.
